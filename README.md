---

Claude Code and Codex each write a JSONL log for every session (`~/.claude/projects/` and
`~/.codex/sessions/`). Those files already know exactly how many tokens you burned, on which
model, in which project. `ccost` reads them locally, prices them, and tells you where your
money went — across both agents at once. Nothing is uploaded.

<sub>Real output from ~6,100 sessions across both agents. On a Max/Pro plan the Claude figures
are equivalent-API-value estimates, not billed dollars — that number is the leverage your
subscription is giving you. Locally-run models (Ollama, `:free`) are correctly counted as $0.</sub>

## Max your 5-hour window

Claude subscription limits reset on a rolling **5-hour window**. The trap isn't only hitting
the wall — it's the opposite: finishing your window having used a fraction of the quota you
already paid for. `ccost window` shows the live picture so you use it fully.

```text
╭──────────────── ccost window · 5-hour quota ────────────────╮

│ Used     ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  70.5M  (13% of your peak)    │
│ Pace     295K/min → ~88.6M by reset (16%)                   │
│ On pace to use less than half your window — push harder.    │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
  Recent windows (vs your peak window)

  Jul 18 18:00    6.2M   ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  1%    ← wasted window
```

- **Reset countdown** — exactly how long until the window rolls, so you front-load heavy work.
- **Burn rate → projection** — where you'll land by reset, and whether that's leaving quota
  unused or about to hit the wall.
- **Per-window fill** — every past window scored, so you can see the ones you wasted.
- The real per-plan cap is undisclosed and dynamic, so `ccost` measures against **your own
  fullest window** by default. Know your budget? Pass `--limit TOKENS` for a true percentage.

`ccost calendar` gives the contributions-style heatmap — which days you leaned in, which you
left on the table.

## Install

`ccost` runs with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — no clone, no virtualenv:

```bash
# one-off run
uvx --from git+https://github.com/namangoyal3/tokenmaxxing ccost

# install as a persistent tool
uv tool install git+https://github.com/namangoyal3/tokenmaxxing
ccost
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/namangoyal3/tokenmaxxing
```

## What you get

- **Total spend** across every session, priced per model with real published rates.
- **By agent** — Claude Code vs Codex, side by side.
- **By model** — where Opus/Sonnet/Haiku/GPT-5 each land on your bill.
- **By project** — which repo is quietly burning the most.
- **Daily / monthly** trends with a `$/day` burn rate.
- **An HTML report** you can share: `ccost html`.
- **JSON** for piping into anything else: `ccost json`.

## The cache angle

Claude Code's cost is dominated by **prompt caching**, and most tools ignore it. Cache
*writes* cost 1.25–2× the input rate; cache *reads* cost only 0.1×. So your bill hinges on
one number: **how often you reuse cached context instead of rebuilding it.**

`ccost` computes your **cache hit rate** and the exact dollars spent creating cache entries.
A low hit rate means long gaps between turns are expiring the 5-minute cache and you're
*re-paying* to rebuild context you already had. That's a knob you can turn — and `ccost` is
the only reader that shows you the knob.

## Tokenmaxxing

`ccost maxx` scores how efficiently you spend and ranks concrete ways to spend less —
in dollars, so you fix the biggest thing first. It separates **reclaim** (waste you can
confidently recover) from **lever** (bigger potential savings that need your judgment).

```text

  Kill idle-gap rebuilds     $21       reclaim   12 turns rebuilt the 5m cache after a >5min gap.
```

What it computes from your logs (not vibes):

- **Idle-gap rebuilds** — turns that came after a >5-minute gap and re-paid to rebuild the
  5-minute cache. Staying active or using the 1-hour cache turns that write back into a
  0.1× read. *(Claude only — needs per-turn timestamps.)*
- **Cold one-shot sessions** — sessions that built cache and never read it. Each short,
  separate session re-pays the first-turn cache build; batching related work avoids it.
- **Model downshift** — how much a model's spend would drop one tier down (Opus→Sonnet).
  A what-if, not a promise: not every turn can downshift, but routing routine edits does.
- **Output trim** — output tokens cost 4–5× input; your output share is the ceiling on
  what terser prompts can save.

## Commands

| Command | Shows |
|---|---|
| `ccost` | Headline summary + cache economics + source/model/project breakdown |
| `ccost window` | Live 5-hour quota: used, burn rate, reset countdown, per-window fill |
| `ccost calendar` | Contributions-style heatmap of daily token usage |
| `ccost maxx` | Token-efficiency score + ranked, quantified ways to spend less |
| `ccost daily` | Cost per day |
| `ccost monthly` | Cost per month |
| `ccost projects` | Cost per project |
| `ccost models` | Cost per model |
| `ccost sources` | Cost per agent (Claude Code vs Codex) |
| `ccost html` | Write a shareable `ccost-report.html` |
| `ccost json` | Dump every priced record as JSON |

Flags: `--source claude\|codex\|all` (default all), `--days N` (last N days),
`--limit TOKENS` (your per-window budget, for `window`), `--dir PATH` (custom Claude log
dir), `--pricing file.json` (override rates), `-o FILE` (html output path).

## Pricing

Prices are USD per million tokens, standard tier, baked in from Anthropic's public pricing.
Cache rates use Anthropic's documented multipliers of the base input rate (read 0.10×,
5-minute write 1.25×, 1-hour write 2.00×). **These are local estimates, not your billed
amount** — Max/Pro plans are flat-rate, and prices drift. Override anything:

```bash
ccost --pricing my-prices.json
```

```json
{ "opus": { "input": 15, "output": 75 }, "sonnet": { "input": 3, "output": 15 } }
```

Models with no public rate (e.g. experimental ones) are priced by best estimate and marked
with `*` in the report.

## Sources

| Agent | Log location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/` (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) | ✅ per-turn usage |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/sessions/` (`CODEX_HOME`) | ✅ per-session totals |
| Gemini CLI / Cursor / OpenCode | — | ❌ don't log per-request token usage locally |

`ccost` reads whatever is present and merges it. Use `--source` to scope to one agent.
Codex reports a *cumulative* token count per session, so ccost takes each session's final
total (never double-counting turns). OpenAI has no cache-write premium, so Codex cache
columns are read-only. New source? [Open an issue](https://github.com/namangoyal3/tokenmaxxing/issues) —
a source is one function that yields `Record`s.

## How it works

1. Walk `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` and `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`.
2. Pull token usage from each assistant turn (Claude) or session total (Codex).
3. Dedupe by message + request id — resumed sessions replay old turns.
4. Price each record cache-aware, aggregate, render.

Pure local reads. No network. ~700 lines of Python.
